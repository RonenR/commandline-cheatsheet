# commandline-cheatsheet

Useful terminal (command line) commands, so to save time looking for them on the web every so often. Includes 'git', and more

Also - includes gitignore files for various projects. Anything useful.

To add a command make sure to leave an empty line before and push 4 places so it shows as code in view online (also enables the cool 'copy' functionality)

See the commands here:
